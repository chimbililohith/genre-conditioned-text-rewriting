      "It is upon these banks, and on these waters, says Michelet, that man is renewed in one of the most powerful climates of the globe. But, beautiful as it was, I could only take a rapid glance at the basin whose superficial area is two million of square yards. Even Captain Nemo’s knowledge was lost to me, for this puzzling person did not appear once during our passage at full speed. I estimated the course which the _Nautilus_ took under the waves of the sea at about six hundred leagues, and it was accomplished in forty-eight hours. Starting on the morning of the 16th of February from the shores of Greece, we had crossed the Straits of Gibraltar by sunrise on the 18th.\n",

      "As per the ancient lore set forth by Michelet, these terrains and waterways are where humanity undergoes renewal across some of the most potent conditions found on Earth. However, the beauty of such landscapes left but a fleeting impression, as I was unable to fully absorb their grandeur. The vast expanse of the basin, with its surface area exceeding two million square yards, remained beyond my reach due to the mystifying presence of Captain Nemo, who never appeared aboard his ship, the Nautilus. Despite navigating through the depths of the ocean at an astonishing pace, the journey covered approximately six hundred miles, completed in just forty-eight hours. Our voyage began on the morning of the 16th of February near the coasts of Greece, culminating in the crossing of the Strait of Gibraltar just before dawn on the 18th day of February.' has dtype incompatible with float64, please explicitly cast to a compatible dtype first.\n",
